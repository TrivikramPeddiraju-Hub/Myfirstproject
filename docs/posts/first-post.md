# Why I’m Building My First Portfolio + Blog

I’m starting simple: a single page website with **About**, **Skills**, **Projects**, and a **Blog**.

**My goals:**
1. Learn web development by actually shipping something.
2. Keep notes on what I learn and show progress.
3. Grow into real projects like a Spring Boot API and an AI-powered to-do app.

Next:
- Add my GitHub + LinkedIn links
- Write “How I deployed this site on GitHub Pages”
- Start the Spring Boot CRUD API as a second project
